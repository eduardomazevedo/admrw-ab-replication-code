## Constants
alpha
  benchmark estimate of alpha
lean-gain-10
  percent gain of trying 10 percent more ideas with the same amount of data
lean-gain-20
  same thing with 20 percent.
more-data-gain-F
  Total gain in SSR% from having 10% more data to study the 1500 or so ideas in the data.
more-data-gain-pc
  This gain in percent terms.
sigma-n-typical
  representative standard error used in counterfactuals
  assumes the average sigma and 20 million users.
sigma-n-typical
  Typical standard error assuming average sigma and 20 million users. We will use this definition of typical throughout.
outlier-delta
  4 * typical standard error
outlier-p
  its posterior mean
marginally-significant-p
  2 * typical standard error
marginally-significant-delta
  its posterior mean
typical-delta-star
  optimal threshold for a typical experiment
typical-t-star
  optimal t stat threshold for a typical experiment
cost-to-rationalize-p-value
  cost to rationalize the p value policy in a typical experiment.
pareto-ratio-p-value
  gain from the top 2% ideas in a p value policy and historical data. measure in percent of total.
historical-gain-optimal
  total historic true gain of the optimal policy
optimal-vs-p-value-gain
  percent increase in total historic gain from moving to optimal implementation strategy relative to p value policy.
alternative-alpha
  benchmark alpha plus one
loss-alternative-alpha
  percent reduction in the value of an idea with infinite data from increasing alpha to alternative value
